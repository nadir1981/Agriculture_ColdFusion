## Project: Agriculture Management System (ColdFusion)
## Repository: [Agriculture_ColdFusion](https://github.com/nadir1981/Agriculture_ColdFusion)

---

### 1. Purpose
To develop a web-based Agriculture Management System using ColdFusion that enables farmers, agronomists, and administrators to efficiently manage agricultural operations, crop data, inventory, and reporting.

---

### 2. Stakeholders
- **Farm Owners/Managers**
- **Agronomists**
- **Field Workers**
- **System Administrators**
- **Government/Regulatory Bodies (if applicable)**

---

### 3. Business Objectives
- Digitize farm operations to improve efficiency and record-keeping.
- Enable real-time monitoring of crop health, planting schedules, and yields.
- Manage resources such as seeds, fertilizers, equipment, and labor.
- Generate actionable reports and analytics for informed decision-making.
- Facilitate compliance with agricultural regulations.

---

### 4. Scope

#### 4.1 In Scope
- Crop and field management (planting, harvesting, monitoring)
- Resource and inventory management (seeds, fertilizers, equipment)
- Scheduling and task assignment for field workers
- Data entry and management for weather, pests, and disease tracking
- Reporting and analytics dashboards
- User authentication and role-based access
- Audit trail for sensitive actions

#### 4.2 Out of Scope
- Integration with external hardware (e.g., IoT sensors)
- Mobile application development (web-based only for initial phase)
- Financial/accounting modules
- Advanced machine learning features

---

### 5. Functional Requirements

#### 5.1 User Management

- Roles: Admin, Manager, Worker, Viewer

#### 5.2 Crop & Field Management
- Add/Edit/Delete crop records
- Assign crops to fields
- Track planting and harvesting dates
- Monitor crop health and yield estimates

#### 5.3 Inventory Management
- Add/Edit/Delete inventory items
- Track quantities and usage history
- Low-stock alerts

#### 5.4 Scheduling & Tasks
- Create and assign tasks to users
- Calendar view for activities
- Notifications/reminders

#### 5.5 Data Entry & Monitoring
- Weather data logging
- Pest and disease occurrence tracking
- Attach images/documents to records

#### 5.6 Reporting
- Generate reports on crop yields, inventory status, etc.
- Export reports to CSV/PDF

#### 5.7 Security
- User authentication
- Role-based access to modules
- Secure storage of sensitive data

---

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The system should support up to 100 concurrent users without significant latency.
- **Scalability:** Ability to add new modules (e.g., livestock management) in the future.
- **Usability:** Simple, intuitive UI for users with varying tech proficiency.
- **Reliability:** >99% uptime during farming seasons.
- **Security:** Data encryption, secure authentication, regular backups.

---

### 7. Assumptions & Dependencies

- Users will access the system via modern web browsers.
- The application will be hosted on a secure server with ColdFusion support.
- Initial data migration from existing spreadsheets/manual records may be required.

---

### 8. Success Criteria

- System is live and accessible to all stakeholders within 6 months.
- At least 90% of daily farm operations are digitized.
- Stakeholders report improved efficiency and record accuracy after 3 months of use.
- Compliance reports are generated and submitted on time.

---

### 9. Risks

- Resistance to technology adoption by users
- Data migration challenges
- Server reliability and backup failures

---

### 10. Glossary

- **ColdFusion:** Web development platform used for backend logic.
- **Crop:** Any cultivated plant on the farm.
- **Field:** Physical area where crops are grown.

---
